Last Updated: March 16, 2026

This page lists subprocessors used to deliver cyang.io and Doclinks services. Subprocessors are selected for operational necessity and are expected to maintain appropriate security and privacy controls.

## 1. How We Use Subprocessors
Subprocessors are engaged to support infrastructure, storage, delivery, billing, communications, and operational security.

## 2. Subprocessor Selection Principles
We evaluate subprocessors for:

- security posture,
- reliability and operational maturity,
- privacy and contractual safeguards,
- service fit for controlled document delivery.
