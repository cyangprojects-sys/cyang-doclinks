# Service Level Agreement (SLA)
Effective Date: March 01, 2026

This SLA applies to paid subscription plans only.

## 1. Uptime Commitment

cyang.io targets 99.9% monthly uptime availability,
excluding scheduled maintenance and force majeure events.

Uptime is calculated as:
(Total Minutes - Downtime) / Total Minutes × 100

## 2. Scheduled Maintenance

We may perform maintenance with reasonable notice.
Scheduled maintenance does not count toward downtime.

- 99.0%–99.89%: 5% service credit
- 95.0%–98.99%: 10% service credit
- Below 95.0%: 20% service credit

Credits apply to future billing cycles only and must be requested within 30 days.

## 4. Exclusions

Downtime does not include:

- Customer-side internet failures
- Misuse or configuration errors
- Force majeure events
- Third-party provider outages beyond reasonable control

## 5. Sole Remedy
